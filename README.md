# Annotation of Image Segmentation on Leaf



### Abstract

Image segmentation is one of the most common and crucial tasks in image
processing and computer vision. Segmentation is defined as the process of 
partitioning an image into a set of nonoverlapping regions, we can group the 
pixels according to local image properties such as the intensity of the original 
image, patterns or textures that are distinctive to each type of region. Many 
segmentation techniques and algorithms have been implemented and yet, except 
for those relatively uncomplicated scenes, the problem of segmentation remains
unsolved. Many approaches have been taken to tackle the image segmentation 
problem, and some of the famous segmentation methods such as Clustering, 
Edge-based and Region-based. 

This project will be using *Watershed segmentation*, which is an edge-based segmentation technique. MATLAB is used in
this segmentation project.
